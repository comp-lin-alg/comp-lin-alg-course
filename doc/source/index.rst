   This module is led by `Prof. Colin Cotter
   <http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/colin.cotter>`_.

   IMPORTANT: This is the 2021/22 version of the course. There will be
   updates and a new Github Classroom project for 2022/23 academic year.
   
   A PDF version of the course notes is `available here
   <Computationallinearalgebracourse.pdf>`_.  The lecture material for this
   course is available as videos linked from the web version of the
   notes.

   The text for this part of the module is Trefethen and Bau
   *Numerical Linear Algebra*. Another very useful reference is
   Golub and van Loan *Matrix Computations*.

   We provide a complete set of notes for the course below, based on
   this material.
