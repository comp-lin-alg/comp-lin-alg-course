   A PDF version of the course notes is `available here
   <Computationallinearalgebra.pdf>`_.

   The theory part of the module will consist of two hours per week
   primarily composed of lectures, with occasional tutorials. This part of
   the module will be led by `Prof. Colin Cotter
   <http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/colin.cotter>`_.

   The text for this part of the module is Trefethen and Bau
   *Numerical Linear Algebra*. Another very useful reference is
   Golub and van Loan *Matrix Computations*.

   We provide a complete set of notes for the course below, based on
   this material.
