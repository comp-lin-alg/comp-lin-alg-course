   This module is led by `Prof. Colin Cotter
   <http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/colin.cotter>`_.
   
   A PDF version of the course notes is `available here
   <Computationallinearalgebracourse.pdf>`_.  The lecture material for this
   course is available as videos linked from the web version of the
   notes.

   The text for this part of the module is Trefethen and Bau
   *Numerical Linear Algebra*. Another very useful reference is
   Golub and van Loan *Matrix Computations*.

   The automated documentation for the skeleton code is below.
