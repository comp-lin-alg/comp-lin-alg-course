Errata for 2021/22
==================

Here we'll list all the updates to the exercises and coursework Classroom
repositories for Autumn 2021. An up to date version is in the
`public repository <https://github.com/comp-lin-alg/comp-lin-alg-course>`_.

1. The docstring for :code:`cla_utils.rank2` was updated to show the
   correct indices. Now reads: "Return the rank2 matrix A = u_1v_1^* +
   u_2*v_2^*." See the code on the course website for the up-to-date
   version.

2. The skeleton code for exercises2.GS_classical was amended as the
   function should just return R, not Q and R.

3. Updated the sign of the inequality in the formula for $r$ in Section 2.2.
