Errata for 2021/22
==================

Here we'll list all the updates to the exercises and coursework Classroom
repositories for Autumn 2021. An up to date version is in the
`public repository <https://github.com/comp-lin-alg/comp-lin-alg-course>`_.

1. The docstring for :code:`cla_utils.rank2` was updated to show the
   correct indices. Now reads: "Return the rank2 matrix A = u_1v_1^* +
   u_2*v_2^*." See the code on the course website for the up-to-date
   version.

2. The skeleton code for exercises2.GS_classical was amended as the
   function should just return R, not Q and R.

3. Updated the sign of the inequality in the formula for `r` in Section 2.2.

4. Replaced `r_{11}/r_{11}` by `r_{1n}/r_{11}` in the final column of the
   right-multiplied `R` matrix in Section 2.5.

5. Updated docstring in :code:`cla_utils:get_Lk` and the corresponding
   test so that `k` corresponds to the column being operated on.

6. Corrected the upper limit of the sum in the algorithm for forward
   substitution.

7. Corrected the sign of inequalities in :code:`test_solve_U` and :code:`test_solve_L`.
